          PreserveOurLanguages is an initiative dedicated to the digital preservation and promotion of African languages. Founded by Josu√© Godeme, a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student, our mission is to bridge the gap between technological advancement and linguistic heritage.
          We are a team of passionate linguists, technologists, and cultural advocates working to:

          <br></br>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Create digital resources for underrepresented African languages</li>
          <li>Develop AI-powered translation tools for native African languages</li>
          <li>Document and preserve oral traditions and folktales</li>
          <li>Promote the use of African languages in education and technology</li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>

          Our work spans from creating the first-ever digital corpora for languages like Adja to partnering with global organizations to develop dictionaries and learning curricula. We believe that every language is a unique window into human experience, and by preserving these languages, we're safeguarding entire worldviews.
